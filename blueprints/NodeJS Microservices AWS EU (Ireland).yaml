# A Website using a microservices architecture developed with Node
# JS and Express JS.
# Deployed in AWS with 1 instance per service.

# 4 Micro Services: API GATEWAY, ORDERS, PAYMENTS, DATA-STORE

# In this sample all the microservices are deployed Simultaneously.
# Their integration is done by using the sandbox Local
# DNS service (see the applications start scripts to see how
# we connect them)
# These are their dependencies:
#     DATA-STORE > stands on its own
#     API GATEWAY > integrates with: ORDERS, PAYMENTS
#     ORDERS > integrates with : PAYMENTS, DATA-STORE
#     PAYMENTS > integrates with: DATA-STORE
